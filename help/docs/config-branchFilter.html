      Each revision of a source file is placed within a branch. &nbsp;A branch is a parallel line
      of development and is used to separate different development tasks that operate on the same
      file at the same time. &nbsp;By default, if no branch is specified, the HEAD or MAIN branch
      is used. &nbsp;Entire branches can be filtered based on branch name. &nbsp;Multiple branches
      can clutter a revision graph and reduce the performance of rendering the graph. &nbsp;Older
      branches, for example, may not be important anymore and could be filtered out. &nbsp;The
      filter can be either to include or exclude the branches that match the filter based on the
      show/hide toggle.
