      Each revision of a source file has a commit date of when that version of the file was checked
      into the CVS&nbsp;repository. &nbsp;This can be used to filter which revisions of a file's
      history are shown in the revision graph. &nbsp;The filter can be either to include or exclude
      the revisions that match the filter based on the show/hide toggle. &nbsp;An after date/time,
      a before date/time, or both an after and before date/time can be used. &nbsp;The date/time
      can either be typed in manually or selected from the calendar/clock dialog. &nbsp;The
      accepted format for the date/time is:<br>
      <br>
       MMM dd, yyyy hh:mm:ss a<br>
      <br>
       Selecting the date/time from the calendar/clock dialog will automatically put the value in
      the correct format.
