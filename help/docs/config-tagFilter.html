      Each revision of a source file can have optional tags placed on it. &nbsp;These tags are
      typically used for build history, merge history, or release management. &nbsp;These tags are
      simple strings and may clutter a revision graph if not important. &nbsp;If tags are set to be
      shown inside the revision graph nodes, then they can be filtered based on a regular
      expression. &nbsp;The filter can be either to include or exclude the tags that match the
      filter based on the show/hide toggle. &nbsp;For proper regular expression syntax, see <a
