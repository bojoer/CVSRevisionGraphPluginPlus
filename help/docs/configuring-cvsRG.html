      The configuration dialog is obtained from the project-level settings of the main IntelliJ
      settings dialog. &nbsp;The default graph filters are used by default for each new revision
      graph that is invoked. &nbsp;These filters can be changed after the revision graph is visible
      from operations in the toolbar of the revision graph window.
