      CVS Revision Graph&nbsp;is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA 6/7 that provides the ability to render
      a directed graph representation of the revision history of a file in a CVS&nbsp;repository.
      &nbsp;In provides similar information to the Show History window, but in picture form.
      &nbsp;This provides a view more easily understood as a file's revision history gets cluttered
      with branching and merging. &nbsp;A revision graph can get large and slow to display.
      &nbsp;Therefore, filters can be applied to help remedy this problem. &nbsp;The revision date
      filter provides the option to filter in or out by commit date before and/or after a specified
      filter date. &nbsp;The tag filter provides the option to control which CVS&nbsp;tags are
      shown/hidden inside each revision node. &nbsp;The branch filter provides the option to filter
      in or out entire parallel development lines or branches. &nbsp;All of these filters have
      default values that can be specified in the settings dialog.<br>
      <br>
       CVS does not store merge history to allow it to know which revision was merged from one
      branch to another. &nbsp;However, if a specific commit message pattern is followed for merged
      files of the form:<br>
      <br>
       Merge From: [branchName]<br>
       Revision: [revisionNumber]<br>
      <br>
       then the revision graph will draw red merge arrows connecting the source and target of the
      merge.<br>
      <br>
       Additional operations can be performed within the revision graph window to compare any two
      selected revisions, to retrieve a selected revision into the active editor, and to add/remove
      tags.
