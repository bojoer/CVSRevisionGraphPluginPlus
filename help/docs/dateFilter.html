      From within the revision graph window, the default date&nbsp;filters from the settings dialog
      can be overridden. &nbsp;The filter can be either to include or exclude the revisions that
      match the filter based on the show/hide toggle. &nbsp;An after date/time, a before date/time,
      or both an after and before date/time can be used. &nbsp;The date/time can either be typed in
      manually or selected from the calendar/clock dialog. &nbsp;The accepted format for the
      date/time is:<br>
      <br>
       MMM dd, yyyy hh:mm:ss a<br>
      <br>
       Selecting the date/time from the calendar/clock dialog will automatically put the value in
      the correct format.
